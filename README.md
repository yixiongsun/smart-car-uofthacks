# Smart Car Connect
Smart car connect is a hackathon project for UofTHacks. It includes an android app that is a front end client connected to the node.js backend that interacts with the SmartCar Api to control supported Smart Cars.

# Getting Started

  1. Clone or download the project
  2. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed to run the server. Note that the server is hosted at https://smartcarconnect.net so you don't actually need to start the server yourself.
  3. Open the android app in Android studio and compile to run.

# TODO LIST
- Setup a database for persistent storage online, either using firebase or mongodb
- Adding cron/task module to the server for interval requests
- Exposing the data and adding analytics, ie. Graphs, Time lapse and visual integration with google maps, clustering data for regular driving habits
